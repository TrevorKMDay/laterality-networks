# Laterality: WTA

These scripts are for laterality analysis of the probabilistic networks, both
the winner-take-all (WTA) binary maps and the probabilistic assignments
themselves.

## Processing code

### calculate_mat_stuff_MSI

These scripts take a single 59,412 by 16 (two empty networks) matrix, and
calculates the mean difference and the _t_-test model and saves them out
because the data is far too large to do it at once.
